# Warranty_Classification_Prediction


***The aim of this study is to develop a tool that can be used to discriminate warranty failure and success using classification models that uses the date of failure, Time of failure, Number of returns as the model parameters.***

* To develop a warranty failure analysis tool using classification algorithms
* To analyze the factors associated with the failure using decision tree algorithm and logistic regression 
* To reduce the risk of finding an appropriate classification algorithm that will save cost spent on poor warranty terms.


To run this model
``` python main.py```
